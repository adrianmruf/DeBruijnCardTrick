The trick has five audience members cut a deck of cards repeatedly and then take a card each.
The mathematician then asks a few questions: “Who had porridge for breakfast?” “Who is holding
a red card?” “Is anyone a Pisces?” “Who has a dog called Stanley?”. The answers to these
questions are sufficient to allow the mathematician to name the card that each person is holding.

This is a python script that
* Prints the order in which you have to arrange the cards before your performance
* takes the relevant information ("Who is holding a red card?") and prints the values of the cards the spectators are holding
* compiles a LaTeX beamer presentation whose title page displays the five cards the audience members are holding

Have fun performing this trick!
